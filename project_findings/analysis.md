# 1.The objective of the dataset 
To diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements.all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage

# 2. Data details
### Dataset
* Total samples size: 768 
    - Diabetes 268 / Non Diabetes 500  [1:2] Ratio
* Predictor variables: 8 variables
    - Pregnancies : The number of times pregnant
    - Glucose : Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
    - BloodPressure : Blood Pressure (mm Hg)
    - SkinThickness : Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
    - Insulin : 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
    - BMI : Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
    - DiabetesPedigreeFunction : Diabetes Pedigree Function
    - Age : Age
* Labels : 
    - Outcome (1 for Diabetes, 0 for Non-Diabetes)

### Boxplot (a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles)
**The ends of the box represent the lower and upper quartiles, while the median (second quartile) is marked by a line inside the box.**
* Insulin's outliers' is widely spread. It might be incorrect data(or input) so it would be helpful to ask experties' opinions.

### Correlation

# 3. Model and methods Overview

### Model : Random Forest
### Evaluation : ROC and AUC
### Methods : Class_weight for hyperparameter tuning, Upsampling for imbalanced data


# 4. Domain (Types of Diabetes)

## Diabetes Type 1
This type occurs most frequently in children and adolescents
Genetic/Ethnic influence Ex : American Indians(this dataset) , African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos etc 

## Diabetes Type 2
This type occurs in adults and accounts for around 90% of all diabetes cases
Tendency : Heart and blood vessel disease,Overweight 

## Diabetes Gestational diabetes
High blood glucose during pregnancy
Usually disappears after pregnancy but women affected and their children are at increased risk of developing type 2  later in life

# 5. Feature Engeneering and Data Cleaning


## Create new Features

* BMI group
    - Underweight below 18.5,  Normal weight = 18.5–24.9,  Overweight = 25–29.9 , Obesity  over 30 
[reference link for BMI](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi-m.htm)
* Glucose group
    - Normal Below 140 , Prediabetes 140 - 199 (mg/dL ), Diabetes over 200 
[reference link for Glucose](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451)
* Pregnancies group
    - Zero or more than once

## Remove 

* Insulin and Skin Thickness features
    - Insulin(374) and Skin Thickness(227). Most of observations miss both of values. 

## Missing data

* Take Median values to fill out BMI, blood pressure, Glucose's missing values

![data_missing3](/images/missing3.PNG)

## Handling imbalanced data 

* Set class_weights (hyperparameter turning: random forest) 
* **Undersampling**

# 6. Model Selection

## 6.1 Evaluation

Comparason of models' accuracy

![model_comparason](/images/model_comparason.PNG)


## Evaluation of models  : AUC (area under the curve) and ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) 
* *ROC (lines in a chart)*: **a performance measurement for classification problem at various thresholds settings. An ROC curve plots TPR(True Positive Rate) vs. FPR (False Positive Rate) at different classification thresholds.** 

* *AUC (space under lines in a chart)*: **AUC stands for "Area under the ROC Curve." It provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. It ranges in value from 0 to 1. AUC near to the 1 which means it has good measure of separability.**

## 6.2 Score details

#### Comparason of baseline model and turned model

![dataframe of scores](/images/score_report_df.PNG)

#### Comparason of baseline model and turned model trained by undersampled data
Undersampled technique did not improve scores dramatically.

## 6.5 FP and FN studies

**False Positive(Model classify as Diabetes but it is actually NOT diabetes)**
* Age : older than 37 years old **88%**
* Pregnancies: Yes 77 %
* BMI_group_Obesity 77 %
* Glucose pre diabetes 77 %
**False Negative(Model classify as not Diabetes but it is actually diabetes)**
* Age : **20s 55%**,  30s 30%,  40s 15%
* Pregnancies : Yes 80% 
* **BMI obesity or overweight 95% (BMI_group_Obesity 55% , overweight 40% )**
* **Glucose Normal 90%**


# 8. Augumentation and Challenges


## With additional time I would do the following....
* Study deeper on features of FP and FN and create new features to a model.
* Collect more observations since the dataset was too small.
* Ask **experties' advise** of types of diabetes. It would be interesting to know if labels are detailed (Type1, Type2, Gestational)
* Explore different methods for handling imbalanced data resampling (ex: **SMOTE,ENN, Hybrid of Random over + under sampling**)   
* Missing insulin data which could be important feature(based on domain info)
* Use and study more about Predicotor variable "Diabetes Pedigree Function" feature. There was no dedailed explanation of what it was and how it was created. According to "feature imortance" check, this feature will play a good role in random forest model to classify this problem.
* Handling outliers (especially "Blood Pressure" variable)
